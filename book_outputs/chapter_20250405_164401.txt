CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO AGENTIC AND ROBOTIC AI
======================================

    The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, leading to the development of increasingly sophisticated systems capable of performing complex tasks.  Central to this advancement is the concept of agency, which refers to the capacity of an entity to act autonomously and purposefully in its environment.  Agentic AI, therefore, focuses on creating AI systems that exhibit this capacity, making decisions, setting goals, and adapting their behavior based on their experiences.  Robotic AI combines this agentic AI with the physical embodiment of robots, enabling intelligent machines to interact with and manipulate the real world.

    This book delves into the intersection of agentic AI and robotics, exploring the fundamental concepts, key techniques, and real-world applications of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by defining key terms and establishing a historical context, tracing the evolution of AI and robotics from their early days to the current state-of-the-art.  We will discuss the differences between reactive, deliberative, and hybrid AI systems, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in the context of robotic applications.

    The historical context will cover seminal works and milestones in AI and robotics, including early examples of AI-controlled robots, the development of key algorithms such as A*, and the emergence of machine learning techniques like reinforcement learning that have revolutionized the field.  We will highlight the contributions of key researchers and institutions that have shaped the landscape of agentic and robotic AI. We will also discuss ethical considerations, the impact on society and the environment, and the need for responsible development and deployment of these advanced systems.  The chapter concludes by outlining the structure of the book and setting the stage for the detailed exploration of the core concepts and techniques in the chapters to come.  This introduction aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding the exciting possibilities and inherent challenges presented by the confluence of agentic AI and robotics.
